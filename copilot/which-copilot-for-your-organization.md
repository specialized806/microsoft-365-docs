# Which Copilot is right for me or my organization?

Copilot is Microsoft's AI-powered virtual assistant. It uses large language models (LLMs) to answer your questions using a prompt and response interaction.

There are different Copilots available.

**If you're an admin**, this article describes the different Copilots and can help you decide the Copilots that are right for your organization.

**If you're an end user**, have a Copilot installed, and not sure what Copilot you have, then this article can help you understand the Copilot that's installed on your device.

# Microsoft 365 Copilot overview

**Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI-powered tool that helps with your work tasks**.

Users enter a prompt in Copilot and Copilot responds with AI-generated information. The responses are in real-time and can include internet-based content and work content that users have permission to access.

Users get content relevant to their work tasks, and in the context of the Microsoft 365 app they're using.

For example, you're an Operations Manager and are working with human resources to update job descriptions. In a Copilot prompting session, you can ask Copilot to create a job description and also add qualifications that should be included in the description. In the same prompting session, you can expand the generated job description to also create different levels, like Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

You can also [create and use agents](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility) to customize your Copilot experience with your organization's data sources. For example, you're a warehouse manager and you need to know the status of a shipment. You can ask your Copilot shipping agent "What is the status of shipment 1234?" Copilot uses your data sources to get the information and can respond with the status.

This article is for IT admins. It describes the different components that Microsoft 365 Copilot uses and the Copilot features in the Microsoft 365 apps. To learn more about the architecture and how Copilot works, see [Microsoft 365 Copilot architecture and how it works](microsoft-365-copilot-architecture.md).

## The technical details

:::image type="content" source="media/microsoft-365-copilot-architecture/copilot-tenant-architecture.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the Microsoft 365 tenant architecture with Microsoft 365 Copilot and your user data." lightbox="media/microsoft-365-copilot-architecture/copilot-tenant-architecture.svg":::

Microsoft 365 Copilot:

- Pairs with the Microsoft 365 productivity apps that you use every day, like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and others.

  So, you can use Copilot in Word to help create a document, in Excel to get suggestions for formulas, in Outlook to summarize an email thread, and in Teams to summarize meetings.

- Uses content in [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview) to personalize the responses with a user's work emails, chats, and documents. Copilot only shows the data that users have permission to access.

- Coordinates large language models (LLMs). LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These algorithms use deep learning techniques and data sets to understand, summarize, predict, and generate content.

  The LLMs include pretrained models, like Generative Pre-Trained Transformers, like GPT-4, that are designed for these tasks. To learn more about Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT), ask [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com).

## Copilot works with Microsoft 365 apps and Microsoft Graph

Copilot has intelligent features, functionality, and prompting. These features are designed to help users in the context of their work within their Microsoft 365 apps.

Microsoft's LLMs and other components work together. They help users securely access and use your organizational data with AI-powered capabilities. Specifically, Microsoft 365 Copilot uses the following components:

✅ **Microsoft 365 apps**

Apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and Loop work with Copilot to support users in the context of their work. For example, Copilot in Word helps users create, understand, and edit documents.

For more features, see [Copilot features in Microsoft 365 apps](#copilot-features-in-microsoft-365-apps) (in this article).

✅ **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**

With Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, you can draft content, review what you missed, and get answers to questions using open-ended prompts. This information is securely grounded in your work data.

You can use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat in Microsoft Teams, in the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat app, at [Microsoft365.com](https://www.microsoft365.com/), and at [copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

✅ **Microsoft Graph**

Microsoft Graph includes information on users, their activities, and the organization data they can access. The Microsoft Graph API brings a personalized context into the prompt, like information from a user's emails, chats, documents, and meetings.

To learn more, see [Overview of Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview) and [Major services and features in Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview-major-services).

✅ **Semantic index**

Semantic index is generated from content in [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph). It helps create contextually relevant responses to user prompts. It allows organizations to search through billions of vectors (mathematical representations of features or attributes) and return related results.

To learn more, see [Semantic index for Copilot](/microsoftsearch/semantic-index-for-copilot) and [Semantic Index explained by Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtsVRCsdvoU) (opens YouTube's web site).

# Admins can manage some Microsoft 365 Copilot scenarios in the Microsoft 365 admin center

When [Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-overview.md) is available in a tenant, there are some Copilot scenarios that admins can configure in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

The admin center also gives shortcuts to other services that can affect how Copilot is used in your organization.

This article is for IT administrators, and lists some of the Copilot scenarios you can control in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

This article applies to:

- Microsoft 365 Copilot

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you're an end user on a work device, then it's possible your IT admin group turned on Copilot for you. The [Copilot Prompt Gallery](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft/prompts) can help you get started.
>
> - If you're an end user on a personal device, then you might automatically get Microsoft Copilot, which is the free consumer version. To learn more, see [How can Copilot help you?](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals) and [Welcome to Copilot on Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/welcome-to-copilot-on-windows-675708af-8c16-4675-afeb-85a5a476ccb0).

## Before you begin

- The Copilot experience in the Microsoft 365 admin center depends on the Copilot license you have.

  If your organization has a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, then you see settings that can manage some Microsoft 365 Copilot scenarios. If your organization doesn't have a Copilot license, then your configuration options apply to Microsoft Copilot, which is the consumer version of Copilot.

  For more information, see:

  - [Which Copilot is right for your organization?](which-copilot-for-your-organization.md)
  - [Get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-setup.md)

- There are different role requirements, depending on your task.

  To view and make changes to the Copilot scenarios in the Microsoft 365 admin center, sign in with the following account:

  - Global Administrator

  To view the Copilot scenarios in the Microsoft 365 admin center, sign in with the following account:

  - Global Reader

  To learn more about these roles, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

  > [!TIP]
  > Microsoft recommends you sign in with the least privileged role that you need to complete your task. Typically, the Global Administrator role is too powerful for most tasks, including managing the Copilot scenarios described in this article.

- The admin center only shows the services licensed in your tenant. So, this article lists more scenarios than what you might see.

  For example, if you have a Microsoft Viva license, then you see some Viva scenarios. If you have a Power Platform license, then you see some Power Platform scenarios.

  Some services are shortcuts to other admin centers, like Teams. For these services, you need the appropriate role to access those admin centers, like Teams administrator.

  To learn more about the different roles in the admin center, see [Microsoft 365 admin center admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

- Your agreement for Online Services governs Microsoft 365 Copilot used with Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see the [Microsoft Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/customeragreement).

- The Microsoft 365 admin center changes frequently. So the scenarios in this article can be different than what you see in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Open the Copilot page

This section lists the steps to open the Copilot page in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Make sure you sign in with the appropriate role needed for your task. In our example, we want to change the settings. So, we sign in with the Global Administrator role.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as the Global Administrator. For more information on this role, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

2. In the left navigation, select **Copilot**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/microsoft-365-copilot-page/microsoft-365-admin-center-copilot-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Copilot page in the Microsoft 365 admin center.":::

3. If your tenant has a Copilot license, you can select **Overview**, **Discover**, and **Settings**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/microsoft-365-copilot-page/microsoft-365-admin-center-copilot-overview-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Overview, Discover, and Settings options in the Copilot page in the Microsoft 365 admin center." lightbox="media/microsoft-365-copilot-page/microsoft-365-admin-center-copilot-overview-settings.png":::

4. If your tenant doesn't have a Copilot license, then you can select **Discover** and **Settings**. In **Discover**, you can purchase Copilot:

## Scenarios you can manage

This section lists some of the scenarios shown in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Some scenarios are configured in the admin center, while others are shortcuts to other admin centers.

Remember, only the services licensed for your tenant are shown in your admin center experience.

### Reports and licenses

In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) > **Copilot** > **Overview** page, you can view reports and assign (or unassign) Copilot licenses. You can also view the number of active users and the number of licenses that are available.

This view lists some of the popular scenarios that are available in Microsoft 365 Copilot. It also provides shortcuts to more in-depth settings in the admin center, like more usage reports (**Reports** > **Usage**) and license management (**Billing** > **Licenses**).

To learn more, see:

- [Microsoft 365 reports in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/microsoft-365-copilot-usage)
- [Set up Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-setup.md) and [Enable users for Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-enable-users.md)

### Copilot agent consumption meter

✅ Shortcut to the Power Platform pay-as-you-go plan

In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), select **Copilot** > **Settings** > **Copilot agent consumption meter**.

In the admin center, this scenario is a shortcut to the [Power Platform pay-as-you-go plan](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-overview). You don't configure this scenario in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

This scenario creates a billing plan that tracks and manages Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat consumption. When you set up a billing plan, you also select an Azure subscription, and link the necessary environments. This configuration helps manage message capacity, monitor usage, and handle overages, which can help with costs.

To learn more, see:

- [Learn more about the Power Platform pay-as-you-go plan](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-overview)
- [Set up a Power Platform pay-as-you-go plan](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-set-up)

### Copilot diagnostics logs

✅ Configure in the Microsoft 365 admin center

In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), select **Copilot** > **Settings** > **Copilot diagnostics logs**.

When users have an issue and aren't able to send Copilot feedback logs to Microsoft, you can submit feedback logs on their behalf. The data includes prompts and generated responses, relevant content samples, and log files. When you use this scenario to send feedback logs, it temporarily overrides any user level feedback policy.

:::image type="content" source="media/microsoft-365-copilot-page/microsoft-365-admin-center-copilot-diagnostics-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot that allows admins to collect Microsoft 365 Copilot diagnostic logs in the Microsoft 365 admin center." :::

- [Submit admin-initiated Copilot feedback from the Microsoft 365 admin center](provide-feedback.md)
- [Search for and delete Copilot data in eDiscovery](/purview/edisc-search-copilot-data)

### Copilot image generation

✅ Enable in the Microsoft 365 admin center

In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), select **Copilot** > **Settings** > **Copilot image generation**.

When this scenario is allowed, end users can ask Copilot to create, design, and edit images. Users can add these images to their work.

It gives your users internet-based chat and work-based chat with [enterprise data protection](/copilot/privacy-and-protections). Enterprise data protection applies to Copilot Chat prompts and responses when users sign in with a Microsoft Entra account, and is designed for work and education.

  To ensure that users in your organization access Copilot Chat, see [Manage Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat](/copilot/manage).

End users can ask questions not related to the task, but agents are designed to help users with specific tasks.

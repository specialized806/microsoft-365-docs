# Submit admin-initiated Copilot feedback from the Microsoft 365 admin center

> [!VIDEO c67f2b9c-8ba4-44b5-8713-00063e92ba54]

Microsoft 365 Copilot is a product that helps users boost their productivity with large-language models (LLM). While Copilot is designed to provide accurate and informative responses based on the knowledge and data available in the Microsoft Graph, it's important to note that answers may not always be accurate. This is because Copilot generates responses based on patterns and probabilities in language data. Providing feedback is essential to improve the product and make it more dependable for users.

Microsoft 365 Copilot currently allows user-initiated feedback. As an admin, you can give feedback to supplement the user-initiated process. This helps Microsoft receive comprehensive diagnostic data to aid in debugging, especially in cases where users may not be able to provide feedback themselves. By providing feedback on behalf of your users, you can help enhance the overall experience of Copilot for your organization by improving the quality and relevance of its responses.

This article explains how you can initiate feedback on behalf of your users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

- A Microsoft 365 subscription with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license

- Global administrator or AI administrator role to complete the task in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

- An email address of the user who experienced an issue with Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Steps to provide feedback to Microsoft

To provide feedback to Microsoft on behalf of a user who encountered a problem with Microsoft 365 Copilot, follow these steps:

1. Go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) and sign in with **Global Admin** or **AI admin** credentials. Select **Copilot** in the left navigation pane to enter the Copilot home page.

2. Find **Copilot diagnostic logs** and select it to open the Copilot feedback diagnostic logs pane. Review the information and then select **Get started**.

8. Decide whether or not to move forward with the feedback submission to Microsoft. If you choose to share the data, select **Submit**. If you don't want to share the data, select **Cancel**.

9. If you choose **Submit**, make sure that all selected data is accurate and relevant. Once you've reviewed and confirmed all information, select **Submit** to send the feedback. You can view the submitted feedback under **Health** > **Product feedback** in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

    If you select **Cancel**, no data will be sent to Microsoft, and you'll see cancellation message. Microsoft doesn't collect anything before you select **Submit**.

10. Once submitted, you'll receive confirmation that the feedback has been submitted to Microsoft.

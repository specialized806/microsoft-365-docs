## Step 1: Set up pay-as-you-go billing

Microsoft 365 Backup is a pay-as-you-go offering that charges based on consumption, unlike traditional user-based licenses. To set up pay-as-you-go for Microsoft 365 Backup, you need to have this information:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Valid Azure subscription**. An Azure subscription provides a logical container for your resources. Each Azure resource is associated with only one subscription. Creating a subscription is the first step in adopting Azure. To learn more about Azure, see [Azure fundamental concepts](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/fundamental-concepts).
> * **Resource group**. A resource group provides a logical grouping of resources within an Azure subscription.
> * **Region**. The region in which you want to register the service.
> * **Owner or contributor**. Name of an owner or contributor role on the Azure subscription.

Once you have the information on this list, you're ready to [set up pay-as-you-go billing for Microsoft 365 Backup](backup-billing.md).

### Permissions

You must be a [SharePoint Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) or [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up Microsoft 365 Backup.

## Step 3: Create backup policies to protect your data

Now that Microsoft 365 Backup is enabled for your organization, follow through to create policies and start protecting your content.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

2. Select **Settings**.

3. Select **Microsoft 365 Backup** from the list of products.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 admin center panel showing Settings and Microsoft 365 Backup.](../media/m365-backup/backup-setup-admin-center-panel.png)

4. [Create backup policies for OneDrive, SharePoint, or Exchange](backup-view-edit-policies.md#create-backup-policies).

## Multi-geo environments

Microsoft 365 Backup supports the backup of sites and user accounts from both the central and satellite locations if the multi-geo feature is enabled on your tenant. This means that you can add the sites or user accounts from all geos while creating the backup configuration policy via the CSV file upload method. Adding sites via the site picker, search, or filter rules doesn't currently support multi-geo. Those user interface experiences today only support addition of sites in the tenant's central location.

## Admin roles and backup management privileges

Only tenant-level admins can create and manage backups using Microsoft 365 Backup for their users. End users don't have the ability to enable backup or restores for their user account, distribution lists, mailboxes, or sites. It’s important to note that your admin role determines which products you can manage with Microsoft 365 Backup. In the future, we might introduce a Backup admin role that can control the entire tool.

|Admin role  |OneDrive  |SharePoint  |Exchange  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Global Administrator     | ✓        | ✓        | ✓       |
|SharePoint Administrator     | ✓        | ✓        |         |
|Exchange Administrator    |         |         | ✓        |

## Glossary

- **Protection units** – SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts, or Exchange Online mailboxes backed up by the Microsoft 365 Backup tool.

- **Restore point** – A prior point in time from which you can restore a version of your content and metadata. If the protection unit from a prior point in time is identical to the present state of your data, then a restore from that point has no effect on your current data.

- **RPO** – Recovery point objective, or how close in time the most recent restore point is to an impacting event.

- **RTO** – Recovery time objective, or how fast a restore to a prior point in time might complete.

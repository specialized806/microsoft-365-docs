# Create, view, and edit backup policies in Microsoft 365 Backup

## Create backup policies

To use Microsoft 365 Backup for OneDrive, SharePoint, or Exchange, you need to create a backup policy for each product. A *policy* represents the backup plan defined by admins for protecting the Microsoft 365 data of an organization.

A policy contains details of what data (OneDrive accounts, SharePoint sites, and Exchange mailboxes) to protect. Although you see the retention period and backup frequency (which defines the restore point objective), those settings aren't currently variable or modifiable.

Select the **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, or **Exchange** tab for steps to create a backup policy for that product.

# [OneDrive](#tab/onedrive)

Follow these steps to set up a backup policy for OneDrive accounts using Microsoft 365 Backup.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

2. Select **Settings**.

3. Select **Microsoft 365 Backup** from the list of products.

4. On the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, in the **OneDrive** section, select **Set up policy**.

5. On the **Overview** page, review the backup features for OneDrive, and then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Overview page for OneDrive.](../media/m365-backup/backup-overview-page-onedrive.png)

6. On the **Choose selection method** page, you can set up OneDrive user accounts using any or all three ways. A protection scope is the scope of user accounts within OneDrive that you want to protect with Microsoft 365 Backup.

    ![Screenshot of the Choose selection method page for OneDrive.](../media/m365-backup/backup-choose-selection-method-onedrive.png)

    a. Under **Upload a list of accounts in a CSV file**, you can upload a list of accounts to back up via a CSV file.

    The CSV upload feature for bulk addition of sites or user accounts in the backup policy creation workflow can accommodate a maximum of 50,000 entries per CSV file.

    b. Under **Back up accounts that match specific filters**, you can select **Distribution lists** or **Security groups**, or both. The distribution list and security group are flattened when added, meaning the policy won't update dynamically if the groups or distribution list are updated later.

    The rule-based feature for bulk addition of user accounts via security groups or distribution lists can accommodate a maximum of three groups at a time. These rules are static and applied one time only. That is, the security groups or distribution lists are flattened at the time of adding to the backup configuration policy. For example, groups or lists won't be dynamically updated in the system if users are added or removed from the original security group.

    c. Under **Select accounts individually**, you can search and select accounts you want to add to a backup policy.

7. Once you've made the right selections, select **Next** to create the backup policy for OneDrive.

8. On the **Review OneDrive backup policy** page, review the information to make sure it's how you want it, and then select **Create policy** (or **Update policy** if it's an update).

9. The backup policy for OneDrive is created.

    ![Screenshot of the OneDrive backup policy created page.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-created-onedrive.png)

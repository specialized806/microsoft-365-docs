## Overview Page

Once in the portal, you'll see the **Overview** page. This page contains several key elements:

- **ACE Contact**: If you have an Advanced Cloud Engineer (ACE) assigned, you'll see an ACE tile with primary contact information. This lists your ACE email address with a clickable option to start an email. The tile won't be visible to customers without an ACE.
- **Insights: Key Metrics**: This tile lists both your engineering escalations and those escalations that have been resolved for the last six months. An issue is considered an 'engineering escalation' once it has been raised to and assigned to a Microsoft Engineering team member (either through our support organization, or through your usage of the "Escalate to Engineering" feature).
  - Total escalations include open or closed tickets
  - Active escalations include only those tickets that are open
- **Customer Advisory Board (CAB)**: The CAB tile will list the last and next CAB events as well as the last and next community calls. This is informational only; registrations and calendar blockers will continue to be provided separately through existing process channels.
- **Insights: Escalation Trend Per Week by Status**: A monthly view of escalations by open and closed for the last six months. This is a focused view of all reactive issues, filtered by all issues that have a Microsoft engineering element.
- **Request A Feature**: Allows you to submit feedback or a request to the Engineering Direct Portal team. Feedback can be both related to the portal itself and its functionality, and any broader engineering features you would like to see in Engineering Direct. Feature requests submitted via this method are visible to users in your private **MyFeedback** section of the feedback portal.

### Visual Mail Flow

Visual Mail Flow enables you to examine issues related to mail flow, such as email submission, group expansion, processing by transport agents (such as AntiSpam, mail flow rules, Data Loss Prevention), and delivery.

Some common situations where Visual Mail Flow can be useful:

- Checking the delivery status of recipients
- Determining reasons for nonreceipt of emails by certain recipients
- Understanding variations in email delivery between recipients
- Identifying mail flow rules applied to an email and their actions
- Identifying Data Loss Prevention rules applied to an email and their actions

#### Input Requirements

To use Visual Mail Flow, you need either the email's Message ID *or* the Network Message ID. You can locate either the message ID or the network message ID by opening the email in question, go to **File** -> **Properties** -> **Internet headers**. You can parse through the headers to find either the message ID or network ID. Alternatively, you can copy/paste the entire internet header box and use a tool like [Message Header Analyzer](https://mha.azurewebsites.net/) to parse this information for you.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the submitted messages are within the age range of 1 to 90 days.

- **Message ID**: Found in the email header with the "Message-ID:" token. Users can provide this information to help investigate specific messages. Be sure to include the full message ID. This might include angle brackets (<>). Although the form varies depending on the email system, here's an example of what a message ID would look like: `<08f1e0f806a47b4ac109109ae6ef@server.domain>`.
- **Network Message ID**: Found in the email header with the "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Network-Message-Id:" token. An example of a network message ID is `4d4c1224-7398-4e8e-949f-ce1932c4ab9d`.

#### Running the Diagnostic

Enter either the Message ID or Network Message ID, then select **Troubleshoot** to start the diagnosis. Results are generated in approximately 30 seconds.

#### Understanding the Results

The Visual Mail Flow diagnostic result includes:

- **Summary**: General conclusion on the mail flow.
- **Highlights**: List of outstanding info and detected issues.
- **Recommendations**: Intelligent recommendations for resolving detected issues.

The **Visual Mail Flow Tree** is an interactive display showing the stages an email went through, with the ability to zoom, drag, and view detailed node information. By examining the tree, you can gain a detailed understanding of how Exchange Online processed the email. In some cases, you might notice that the tree node is split into multiple child nodes. This is due to Exchange Online's bifurcation feature, which separates recipients into multiple sets to process them separately during mail flow.

![Engineering direct portal visual mail flow page](../media/eng-direct-portal/eng-direct-portal-visual-mail-flow.png)

#### Investigating Further

Select a tree node to view a flyout with other details, including recipients processed and node-specific properties for troubleshooting mail flow issues. The flyout contains other details for you to review and investigate. It contains a common “Recipients” property to show which recipients this node processed, and more node-specific properties that vary between nodes to help better troubleshoot mail flow issues.

> [!TIP]
> Emails sent to many recipients or large groups will take a longer time to query or could time out. Querying emails with fewer recipients could improve your experience.

    - Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/homepage).

    - Navigate to _Users > Active users_.

    - Click on the desired user.

    - On the Account Tab, under _Sign-out_, select _Sign out of all sessions_.

2. Reset Password - [Reset the password.](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/reset-passwords) Don't send the new password to the user through email, because the attacker may still have access to the mailbox. Be sure to use a strong and unique password: upper and lowercase letters, at least one number, and at least one special character.

    - The last time a user reset the password will be displayed.

3. Enable multifactor authentication - [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) is crucial for enhancing security and protecting user accounts. [Enable MFA](/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication).

    - A list of types of MFA enabled on the user will be displayed.

4. Block Suspicious IP Addresses - Blocking suspicious or harmful IP addresses is an essential cybersecurity measure. [Review the IP Addresses that have activity on this account and block any that are suspicious](/defender-office-365/tenant-allow-block-list-urls-configure).

    - A list of IP addresses that performed actions on the account will be displayed.

5. Remove Account from Administrative Roles - To ensure that the attacker can't perform administrative actions, [remove compromised account from any administrative roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?WT.mc_id=365AdminCSH_SupportCentral). You can restore the user's membership once the account is secured.

6. Enable Mailbox Logging - Mailbox logging is the capability of capturing and analyzing audit logs related to security, compliance, and other activities within Microsoft 365 or Office 365. [Enable mailbox logging.](/purview/audit-log-enable-disable?tabs=microsoft-purview-portal)

    - The status of logging on the mailbox will be shown (Enabled or Disabled).

7. Remove Unusual Mailbox Delegates - A mailbox delegate is someone you authorize to manage your email and calendar on your behalf. Displayed below are all the delegates that aren't the mailbox owner. [Delete any unknown users.](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-permissions-for-recipients)

    - Users who have delegate permission will be displayed with the fields `user (email)`, `isinherited`, and `access rights`.

8. Remove Unusual Inbox Rules - Inbox rules are often used by attackers to forward emails to themselves. [Check if there are any unusual rules and delete them.](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules)

    - The inbox rules registered on the mailbox will be displayed with the identity, name, description, `forwardto` address, and enabled status.

9. Remove Unusual SMTP Forwarding - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the protocol responsible for sending emails from the sender's email client to the email server. [Check if there is SMTP forwarding.](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/manage-user-mailboxes)

    - SMTP forwarding registered on the mailbox will be displayed.

10. Remove Unusual Accepted Domains - An accepted domain in a mailbox allows users in a domain to send and receive mail. [Delete any unusual domains.](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains)

    - Accepted domains registered on the tenant will be displayed.

11. Remove Unusual Inbound and Outbound Connectors - Inbound connectors manage email traffic coming into your organization, while outbound connectors control the flow of emails leaving your organization. [Check if there are any unusual connectors and delete them.](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/set-up-connectors-to-route-mail)

    - Connectors registered on the tenant will be displayed.

**Further Steps**

If the user still shows signs of being compromised, reach out to Microsoft Support for further help.

### Audit Log Summary

The audit log summary provides a comprehensive overview or count of the activities tracked within your tenant’s audit log. This diagnostic tool is useful for reviewing admin actions, identifying unusual administrative activity, or investigating potential rogue administrators. 

#### Inputs 

- Search the number of days prior to the current date (max 30 days)

  - If you enter 10, the diagnostic will review the log for up to 10 days prior to the current date
  
  - If left blank, the diagnostic will run with the value of 7 days 
  
#### Outputs 

The output is split into two sections: 

1. Users with High Activity – Users who have performed a specific action at a much higher rate than the average user will be listed here, along with the count of each action they have taken. 

1. Full User List – All users, along with a list of their activities and corresponding counts, will be displayed here in alphabetical order. Actions performed by apps will be grouped together. 

### Issues with Guest Access in Teams

The Microsoft Teams Guest Access Diagnostic is designed to resolve issues that might prevent guests from joining a team. It covers potential problems related to inviting guests, accessing team content, and using certain guest features. Since guest settings are controlled both at the organizational and team levels, the diagnostic identifies any misconfigurations that could affect guest access. It consolidates all these issues into a single report, where each misconfiguration is accompanied by administrative guidance. Moreover, it reviews how guest user accounts are provisioned and accepts optional inputs at the organization, team, and user levels, allowing you to tailor the output to your needs.

#### Org-level settings  

These settings at the organization-level are evaluated to check for misconfiguration.  

|Setting|Where it is located|Setting values considered “misconfigured”|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|External collaboration setting’s guest invite setting 	|Microsoft Entra Admin Center |"No one in this organization can invite guest users including admins (most restrictive)"  "Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guests" |
|M365 group guest settings 	|Microsoft Admin Center |Either one or both settings are turned off:   "Let group owners add people outside your organization to Microsoft 365 Groups as guests"  "Let guest group members access group content" |
|SharePoint External Sharing settings |SharePoint Admin Center |"Only people in your organization" Existing guests only" |
|Guest Access setting |Teams Admin Center |Off |

#### User-level Setup 

If a guest user is supplied as an input, the diagnostic verifies their account provisioning in both Entra and Teams. Furthermore, if a Teams team is also provided, it checks whether that guest is a member of the specified team. 

##### Additional Settings 

In addition, this diagnostic also displays some settings that could affect your guest access experience. These settings are not evaluated for misconfiguration.  

1. External collaboration’s collaboration restriction setting and guest user access restriction setting in Microsoft Entra Admin Center 

    ![Guest user access restriction setting and collaboration restriction setting](../media/eng-direct-portal/eng-direct-portal-additional-settings-1.png)

1. Guest feature settings in Teams Admin Center 

    ![Guest feature settings](../media/eng-direct-portal/eng-direct-portal-additional-settings-2.png)   

1. Teams guest permissions in Teams app  

    ![Teams guest permissions in Teams app](../media/eng-direct-portal/eng-direct-portal-additional-settings-3.png) 

We aim for this diagnostic to resolve your guest access issues and provide a seamless guest experience in Teams. If problems persist, please reach out to Microsoft support for assistance. 

### Teams PSTN Calling Diagnostic

Microsoft Teams Phone uses the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) when a user places an external call outside of their organization. The PSTN is essential for connecting Teams with traditional telephone networks, and its functionality is critical for organizations relying on Teams for comprehensive communication, both domestically and internationally.  

To place external calls, users have several PSTN connectivity options available under Microsoft Teams (more here: [Microsoft Teams add-on licenses - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing)). One prevalent option is the Calling Plan, which accommodates both domestic and international PSTN calling. Understanding these PSTN connections is crucial because any issues can directly impact an organization's communication capabilities, potentially hindering business operations and external engagement. 

This diagnostic tool assists administrators in identifying and resolving issues with PSTN calling through the Calling Plan feature in Teams. This comprehensive diagnostic process ensures that both the technical configuration and licensing prerequisites for PSTN connectivity via Microsoft Teams are thoroughly evaluated, helping organizations maintain reliable external communication. 

#### Running the Diagnostic 

The diagnostic requires the affected user’s organizational email address. With a simple selection of the ‘Troubleshoot’ option, the tool starts analyzing the configuration, with results available in approximately 30 seconds. 

#### Interpreting Diagnostic Results 

The diagnostic performs a series of configuration checks related to Teams Phone settings, with a particular focus on verifying whether the user has been assigned a domestic or international Calling Plan license. This verification is key in determining if the user can successfully make or receive PSTN calls outside the organization. By highlighting any discrepancies or license issues, the diagnostic assists administrators in pinpointing problems that might cause call failures or connectivity issues. 

#### Investigating Further 

If the troubleshooting process does not resolve the PSTN calling issue, administrators are advised to contact Microsoft Support for more specialized assistance.

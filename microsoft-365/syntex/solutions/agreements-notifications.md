# Approval notifications in SharePoint Agreements

Agreement approval notifications are sent through the Approvals app in Microsoft Teams. Agreement creators can also choose to notify approvers via email.

The process to configure and send approvals is provided in [Create a template with the SharePoint Agreements AI solution](agreements-create-template.md). This article provides the actions a recipient of the notification for an approval request can take.

## View requests in the Approvals app

1. When a request for approval is sent to you, you receive an approval notification as a notification in Microsoft Teams.

2. To see all your current approvals regardless of status, go to the [Approvals app in Microsoft Teams](/power-automate/teams/native-approvals-in-teams#use-the-approvals-app-in-teams). Filter the requests by status (**Requested**, **Approved**, or **Canceled**).

3. Select the request title to see more details about the request. For requests where you're the approver, you can **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Reassign** the request. You can also provide other comments before taking an action. For requests you created, you can choose to **Follow up** or **Cancel the request**.

4. To open the agreement in Microsoft Word, select the link.

# Set up SharePoint Agreements

## Overview

There are a few steps to setting up the solution.

1. A Global Administrator [procures and assigns the required SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial license](agreements-license-requirements.md#assign-the-license-to-users).

2. A SharePoint Administrator [creates a workspace](#create-workspaces).

3. Workspace owners [configure their workspace](#configure-the-workspace).

4. Deploy the [Agreements app to Microsoft Teams](#add-the-agreements-app-in-microsoft-teams).

## Create workspaces

Workspaces allow you to organize and manage agreements across your organization. When you create a workspace, a SharePoint site is created and is assigned to the workspace. You can create workspaces for business processes or departments in your organization that manages agreements. For example, you can have one workspace for your procurement team, and another one for your human resources team. Agreements, templates, and other files exist within the workspace and are stored in the corresponding SharePoint site. Roles are assigned to users at a workspace level, and permissions can be managed at a workspace level.

### Prerequisites

Before creating a workspace for SharePoint Agreements, you need to ensure:  

- The user implementing the steps in the article needs to be either a Global Administrator or SharePoint Administrator.

   [!INCLUDE [global-administrator-note](../../includes/global-administrator-note.md)]

- The [SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial license](agreements-license-requirements.md#assign-the-license-to-users) is assigned to users in your organization.

- Download and install the latest [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35588).

- The minimum required version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell is 16.0.25513.12000.

- It is recommended that only the latest version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell is installed.

- Review instructions at [Get Started with the SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online) to validate the version you have installed, uninstall previous versions or update the current version to ensure the pre-requisites have been met.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must be a SharePoint Administrator or Global Administrator to create sites through the SharePoint Online Management Shell.

### Create a workspace

1. Launch the SharePoint Online Management Shell, and sign in as a Global Administrator or SharePoint Administrator.

2. Run the following command to connect to your tenant.

   ```
   Connect-SPOService -Url "https://<tenantName>-admin.sharepoint.com"
   ```

   Where:

   - \<tenantName> is the name of your SharePoint tenant. <br><br>

   Example: 
   ```
   Connect-SPOService -Url "https://contosoelectronics-admin.sharepoint.com"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Connect-SPOService cmdlet might require the use of modern authentication to connect. For information about how to add modern authentication flow to your SPO-Connect cmdlet, see the [Connect-SPOService documentation](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/connect-sposervice).

4. Run the following command to create a new SharePoint site and set it as an Agreements workspace.

    ```
   New-SPOSite -Url "<URL>" -Owner "<user>" -StorageQuota 1000 -Title "<Workspace Name>" -EnableAgreementsSolution -Template "STS#3"
    ```

    Where:

    - \<URL> is the target URL of the new site.  
    - \<User> is the email address of the owner of the new workspace.
    - \<Workspace Name> is the name you would like for the new workspace.
  
    Example:
   ```
   New-SPOSite -Url "https://contosoelectronics.sharepoint.com/teams/LegalAgreements" -Owner "megan@contosoelectronics.onmicrosoft.com" -StorageQuota 1000 -Title "Legal agreements" -EnableAgreementsSolution -Template "STS#3"
   ```

## Deploy the Agreements app to users in Microsoft Teams

As a Global administrator or a Teams administrator, you can [manage the Agreements app in the Microsoft Teams Admin Center](/microsoftteams/manage-apps) and deploy the app to all users or specific users in your organization.

### Add the Agreements app in Microsoft Teams

To add the Agreements app to Microsoft Teams, follow these steps (no administrator privileges needed):

1. Launch Microsoft Teams.

# Create an enterprise model in Microsoft Syntex

<sup>**Applies to:**  &ensp; &#10003; All custom models &ensp; | &ensp; &#10003; All prebuilt models</sup>

An enterprise model is created and trained in the [content center](create-a-content-center.md), and can be discovered by others to use. Whether you want to create a custom model or use a prebuilt model, you can do so from any of these places in Microsoft Syntex:

- From the **Models** library
- From the [content center](create-a-content-center.md) home page
- From any document library in a site where Syntex has been activated

For this article, we start in the **Models** library. For information about the different model types, see [Overview of model types in Syntex](model-types-overview.md).

If you want to create a local model, see [Create a model on a local SharePoint site](create-local-model.md).

## Create a custom model

1. From the **Models** library, select **Create a model**.
<!---
![Screenshot of the Models library showing the Create a model button.](../media/content-understanding/create-a-model-from-the-models-page.png) 
--->
2. On the **Options for model creation** page, select the **Custom models** tab.

    ![Screenshot showing the Custom models section on the Options for model creation page.](../media/content-understanding/create-custom-model-options.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > These available model options are configured by your Microsoft 365 admin. All model options might not be available.
<!---
3. Select the type of custom model you want to create. Choose from the following prebuilt model types:

    - **Single class model** – Creates an [unstructured document processing model](document-understanding-overview.md).

    - **Freeform extraction model** – Creates a [freeform document processing model](form-processing-overview.md).

    - **Structured extraction model** – Creates a [structured document processing model](form-processing-overview.md).
--->
3. Select one of the following tabs to continue with the custom model you want to use.

# [Single class model](#tab/single-class-model)

Use the **Single class model** to create an [unstructured document processing model](document-understanding-overview.md).

1. Select **Single class model**.

2. On the **Single class model: Details** page, you'll find more information about the model. If you want to proceed with creating the model, select **Next**.

3. On the right panel of the **Create a model using a single class model** page, enter the following information.

    - **Model name** – Enter the name of the model, for example *Service agreements*.

    - **Description** – Enter information about how this model will be used.

4. Under **Advanced settings**:

    - In the **Content type** section, choose whether to create a new content type or to use an existing one.

    - In the **Compliance** section, select the retention label or sensitivity label you want to add. If a label has been already applied to the library where the file is stored, it will be selected.

5. When you're ready to create the model, select **Create**.

6. You're now ready to [train the model](create-a-classifier.md).

# [Freeform extraction model](#tab/freeform-extraction-model)

    - In the **Content type** section, choose whether to create a new content type or to use an existing one.

    - In the **Compliance** section, select the retention label or sensitivity label you want to add. If a label has been already applied to the library where the file is stored, it will be selected.

5. When you're ready to create the model, select **Create**.

6. You're now ready to [train the model](create-a-form-processing-model.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > When published, this model type is available for reuse by others who do not own the model. Currently, this model can be edited and shared for editing only by the model owner.

5. When you're ready to create the model, select **Create**.

6. You're now ready to [train the model](create-a-form-processing-model.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > When published, this model type is available for reuse by others who do not own the model. Currently, this model can be edited and shared for editing only by the model owner.

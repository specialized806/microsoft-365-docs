# Requirements and limitations for unstructured document processing in SharePoint

The following table outlines key factors to consider when planning to use an unstructured document processing model.

| Icon          | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![Files symbol.](/office/media/icons/files-blue.png)  | **Supported file types** <br>This model supports the following file types: .csv, .doc, .docx, .eml, .heic, .heif, .htm, .html, .jpeg, .jpg, .md, .msg, .pdf, .png, .ppt, .pptx, .rtf, .tif, .tiff, .txt, .xls, and .xlsx (formulas in .xls and .xlsx files aren't run).|
| ![Conversation symbol.](/office/media/icons/chat-room-conversation-blue.png)  | **Supported languages** <br>This model supports all of the Latin-based languages, including: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. |
| ![Paragraph symbol.](/office/media/icons/paragraph-writing-blue.png)  | **OCR considerations** <br>This model uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology to scan .pdf files, image files, and .tiff files. OCR processing works best on documents that meet the following requirements: <br> - File format of .jpg, .png, or .pdf (text or scanned). Text-embedded .pdf files are better, because there won't be any errors in character extraction and location. <br> - If your .pdf files are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submitting them. <br> - The combined file size of the documents used for training per collection must not exceed 50 MB, and PDF documents shouldn't have more than 500 pages. <br> - For images, dimensions must be between 50 x 50 and 10,000 x 10,000 pixels. Images that are very wide or have odd dimensions (for example, floor plans) might get truncated in the OCR process and lose accuracy. <br> - For .pdf files, dimensions must be at most 11 x 17 inches, corresponding to Legal or A3 paper sizes and smaller. <br> - If scanned from paper documents, scans should be high-quality images. <br> - Must use the Latin alphabet (English characters). <br> Note the following differences about Microsoft Office text-based files and OCR-scanned files (.pdf, image, or .tiff): <br> - All files: Truncated at 64,000 characters (in training and when run against files in a document library). <br> - OCR-scanned files: There's a 500-page limit. Only PDF and image file types are processed by OCR. |
| ![Globe symbol.](/office/media/icons/globe-internet.png)  | **Multi-Geo environments** <br>When setting up Syntex in a [Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo) environment, you can only configure it to use the model type in the central location. If you want to use this model type in a satellite location, contact Microsoft support. |
| ![Objects symbol.](/office/media/icons/objects-blue.png)  | **Multi-model libraries** <br>If two or more trained models are applied to the same library, the file is classified using the model that has the highest average confidence score. The extracted entities are from the applied model only. |

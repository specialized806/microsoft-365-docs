# Set up and manage prebuilt document processing for SharePoint

The prebuilt document processing service for SharePoint is set up in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Prerequisites

### Licensing

Before you can use prebuilt document processing, you must first link an Azure subscription in [Microsoft Syntex pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md). Prebuilt document processing is billed based on the [type and number of transactions](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md).

### Permissions

You must be a [SharePoint Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) or [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up prebuilt document processing.

[!INCLUDE [global-administrator-note](../includes/global-administrator-note.md)]

## Set up prebuilt document processing

After an [Azure subscription is linked to Microsoft Syntex](syntex-azure-billing.md), prebuilt document processing is automatically set up and enabled for all SharePoint sites.

## Manage sites

By default, prebuilt document processing is turned on for libraries in all SharePoint sites. To restrict the sites where users can create prebuilt models for processing files, follow these steps.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997" target="_blank">**Settings > Org settings**</a>.

2. On the **Org settings** page, select **Pay-as-you-go services**.

3. On the **Pay-as-you-go services** page, select the **Settings** tab.

4. Under **Document & image services**, select **Prebuilt document processing**.

5. On the **Prebuilt document processing** panel, select the **Sites** tab.

6. In the **Sites where models can be used** section, select **Edit**.

7. On the **Sites where models can be used** panel, change the setting from **All sites** to **Selected sites (up to 100)**. For selected sites, follow the instructions to select the sites or upload a CSV listing of the sites. You can then manage site access permissions for the sites you selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must be a member of any site that you want to include in the CSV file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Disabling a site after a model is made available to process files on that site doesn't disable the model. Models can still be used to process files and incur charges. A model can be made available to process files by being created on that site or in a content center.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For multi-geo environments, the **No sites** and **Selected sites** settings apply only to the primary geo of multi-geo tenants. If you want to restrict or add sites in nonprimary geos, contact Microsoft support.

8. Select **Save**.

## Turn off prebuilt document processing

When the prebuilt document processing service is turned off, prebuilt models don't run, and users can't create or apply prebuilt models.

To turn off prebuilt document processing, follow these steps.

1. On the **Prebuilt document processing** panel, on the **Settings** tab, clear the **Let people create and apply models to process files** check box.

2. Select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For multi-geo environments, when the service is turned off, the service is off for all geos.

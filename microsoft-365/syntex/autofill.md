# Create an autofill column in Microsoft Syntex

Autofill is a new setting in the **Create a column** panel that lets you use natural language prompts to extract specific information or generate information from files within a SharePoint library. The information is then displayed in the columns of the library. You can set up multiple autofill columns in the same library.

## Create a new autofill column

To create a new autofill column, follow these steps:

1. In a SharePoint library, select **+Add Column**, select the type of column you want, and then select **Next**.

2. On the **Create a column** panel, enter a name for the column heading and a brief description of the column information.

3. In the **Autofill** section, select **Set up**.

4. On the **Autofill** panel, in the **Prompt** box, create the prompt. The prompt identifies the type of information you want to extract from a file to a column.

   For **Text** and **Multiple lines of text** only, a suggested prompt is automatically generated. Select the **Refresh** button to see a different suggested prompt. Select the suggested prompt to add it to the **Prompt** box, and you can edit it as needed. For other column types, see these [suggested prompts](#suggested-prompts-for-other-column-types).

5. In the **Test the prompt** section, select a file to test the prompt using the files in the library. The results display in the **Result** box. If needed, you can modify the prompt and retest it until you achieve the result you want.

6. When have the prompt you want, select **Save**. The new column displays in the library.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are setting up more than one autofill column, you can help minimize your transaction costs by completing the setup of all autofill columns before processing.

7. To process existing library content, select the files for which you want to apply the autofill column. Then from the command bar, select **More options** (**...**) > **Autofill**.

   ![Screenshot showing More option > Autofill on the ribbon.](../media/content-understanding/autofill-ribbon.png)

    You see a message indicating that autofill is starting to process the files and that it might take time to complete processing.

8. After an autofill setting on a column is saved, any new files uploaded to the library are automatically processed, and the extracted information is saved to the corresponding columns.

2. On the **Edit column** panel, in the **Autofill** section, select **Edit prompt**.

3. On the **Autofill** panel, in the **Prompt** box, modify the wording as needed.

4. In the **Test the prompt** section, select a file to test the prompt using the files in the library. You can modify the prompt and retest it until you achieve the result you want.

5. When have the prompt you want, select **Save**.

## Turn off the autofill setting on a column

To turn off autofill on a specific column, follow these steps:

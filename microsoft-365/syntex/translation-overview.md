# Overview of document translation in Microsoft Syntex

> [!NOTE]
> Through June 2025, you can try out a [limited amount](promo-syntex.md#monthly-included-capacity) of document translation and other selected Syntex services at no cost if you have [pay-as-you-go billing](syntex-azure-billing.md) set up. For information and limitations, see [Try out Microsoft Syntex and explore its services](promo-syntex.md).

Microsoft Syntex lets you easily create a translated copy of a selected file or a set of files in a SharePoint document library. You can translate a file in one language or up to 10 language at a time, while preserving the original format and structure of the file. Translation is available for all supported languages and dialects.

This feature lets you translate files of different types either manually or automatically by [creating a rule](content-processing-translate.md).

You can also use the translation feature for translating video transcripts and closed captioning files. For more information, see [Transcript translations in Stream for SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/microsoft-syntex-pay-as-you-go-transcript-translations-in-stream-for-sharepoint-2e34ad1b-e213-47ed-a806-5cc0d88751de).

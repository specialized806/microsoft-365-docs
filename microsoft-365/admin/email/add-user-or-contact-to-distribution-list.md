# Add a user or contact to a Microsoft 365 distribution group

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

As the admin of an organization, you may need to add one of your users or contacts to a distribution group. See [Create distribution groups in Microsoft 365](../setup/create-distribution-lists.md). For example, you can add employees or external partners or vendors to an email distribution group.

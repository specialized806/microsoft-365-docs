Microsoft is transparent about the specific policies, operational practices, and technologies that help you ensure the privacy, security, and compliance of your data across Microsoft 365 Archive.

- Microsoft respects the privacy and ownership of data you use.

- None of your organization's data is used or transferred by Microsoft to train AI models, large-language models, or any other models.

- Your data remains securely within your organization’s tenant.

## Privacy

Microsoft 365 Archive inherits privacy features and settings from Microsoft 365 and SharePoint, where applicable.

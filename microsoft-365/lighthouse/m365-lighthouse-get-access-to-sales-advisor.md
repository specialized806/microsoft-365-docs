# Get access to Sales Advisor in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

This article provides instructions for how to sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Sales Advisor. Even if you have access to Lighthouse, an additional role in Partner Center is required to gain access to Sales Advisor.

Sales Advisor is built for sellers. Customer-facing roles in partner's organization who are focused on business development, customer success, and sales can benefit from directly accessing the sales advisor experience.

## Before you begin

- Your partner tenant must be onboarded to Microsoft 365 Lighthouse.
- You must hold the Account Manager role in Lighthouse. If you don't hold the Account Manager role, reach out to someone who holds the Administrator role in Lighthouse and ask them to assign the role to you.

### Appropriate roles in Partner Center

- The Executive report viewer role gives access to all reporting data sets.
- The Report viewer role gives access to most reporting data sets but not to sensitive data, such as revenue and customer or employee personal information.
- You must hold at least the Account admin role to assign users the above-mentioned roles, which are assigned either for an entire company or for a specific Microsoft Cloud Partner Program location.

For more information, see [CPP role-based access - Partner Center](/partner-center/insights-roles).

## Get access to Sales Advisor

1. Go to Microsoft 365 Partner Center at [https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).

2. Go to **Account Settings** > **User management**.

3. Under **Users**, select the user account to edit permissions.

4. Under **User details**, navigate to **Roles applicable to partner programs** and select **View data and reports for one or more locations (select the locations where the user needs to be able to view data and reports.)**

5. Assign **Report viewer** or **Executive report viewer** role using one of the two methods.

- Select **Entire organization** if you want the user to have access to all locations listed plus any other new locations that will be added in the future.

- Select **One or more locations listed below** and assign **Report viewer** or **Executive report viewer** from the dropdown in Report viewer roles column to grant access by location.

## Next steps

In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Sales Advisor** > **Opportunities**.

# Create a customer report in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

You can create a PDF report in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for each of your customer tenants that shows the status of their security posture along with opportunities to help them get the most value from their existing licenses. The report also summarizes activities that your partner organization performed in Lighthouse to keep the customer safe, secure, and productive. The report is designed to be shared with customers and can be especially helpful during monthly or quarterly business reviews.

## Before you begin

To create a customer report, you must hold at least the Global Reader role in Microsoft Entra ID for the customer tenant. To learn more, see [Overview of permissions in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview-of-permissions.md). For a complete list of Microsoft Entra roles and the actions they can perform, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).

## Create a customer report

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Tenants**.
 
2. Select a tenant that shows **Managed** in the **Lighthouse management** column to open the tenant details page for that tenant.

3. On the **Overview** tab, select **Summary** in the left pane, and then select **Create customer report**.

    A details pane opens showing an overview of the information contained in the report.

4. To create and download a PDF copy of the report, select **Download PDF**.
 
> [!NOTE]
> The data in customer reports is refreshed once a week.

## Next steps

After you download a PDF copy of the report, you can retrieve it from the Downloads folder on your computer and share it with your customer.

# Overview of the Alerts page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

As a Managed Service Provider (MSP), you need to monitor and respond to the security issues of your customers efficiently and effectively. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse provides an alerts tool that gives you a consolidated view of all the high-priority detections and alerts across your customers. You can see a prioritized list of the most urgent issues that require your attention and take immediate action to resolve them. You can also enable push alerts to your existing support systems and flows, so you never miss a critical alert that needs your intervention.

To help you get started, Lighthouse provides a default set of alert rules based on best practices and recommendations. You can use these alert rules as is or modify them according to your preferences and needs. You can also create custom alert rules for more control and flexibility.

## Alerts tab

The **Alerts** tab provides a consolidated view of potential security issues across all your customers. The tab contains two sections:

- **Active alerts by date created**: A graph that displays the number of active alerts over time.

- **Alerts table**: A list of current alerts that can be filtered by alert type, severity, status, or assigned to.
 
The **Alerts** tab also includes the following options:

- **Export:** Select to export alert data to an Excel comma-separated values (.csv) file.
- **Refresh:** Select to retrieve the most current alert data.
- **Search:** Enter keywords to locate a specific alert in the list.

From the list of alerts, select any alert to open the alert details pane. The **Overview** tab in this pane includes the following information:

- Affected tenants
- Alert description
- Rule that triggered the alert
- Alert type
- Time stamp (first detected, last updated)
- Impacted entity

From the **Overview** tab, you can update the severity and status of the alert and assign the alert to a specific user to resolve. 

Select the **Comments and history** tab in the alert details pane to see a complete history of the alert. You can add additional comments to the alert as needed.

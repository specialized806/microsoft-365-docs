# Search for users in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you search for a specific user across all active tenants. This allows you to find a user quickly without needing to navigate different tenants.

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Users** > **Account management**.

2. On the **Search users** tab, enter all or part of a display name or user principal name (UPN) in the search box.

3. From the search results list, select a user to open the user details pane.

## Next steps

Once the user is found, you can reset their password, block their account, or delete their account. For more information, see [Reset user password](m365-lighthouse-reset-user-password.md) or [Block user sign-in in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-block-user-signin.md).

# Understanding staff roles in Microsoft Bookings

In Microsoft Bookings, staff members play a crucial role in managing bookings and ensuring smooth operations. Each staff member is assigned a specific role that determines their access level and responsibilities within the organization's booking system. Understanding these roles is essential for effective coordination and collaboration within the organization.

## Who is a Staff or Team Member?

In Microsoft Bookings, a staff member provides a service for the organization. Imagine you run a wealth management company offering portfolio management services. Now, these services can be provided by different staff members, each with their own schedule. Here's how it works:

1. **Availability matters** Services are only available when at least one staff member is free during the service duration. This ensures that customers can always find a suitable time slot.
2. **Booking a Service** Customers can easily select a service they're interested in and then choose a specific staff member they'd like to meet with. They can then book a time slot that works for them.

## Staff roles

Microsoft Bookings offers various staff roles, each with its own permissions and access levels. These roles are designed to accommodate the diverse needs of organizations and ensure that staff members have appropriate levels of access based on their responsibilities. The following are the different staff roles available in Microsoft Bookings:

- **Team member** Can manage bookings on their own calendar and their availability in the booking mailbox. When adding or editing a booking in their calendar, they'll be assigned as staff.
- **Scheduler** Can manage bookings on the calendar and customer details. They have read-only access to settings, staff, and services.
- **Viewer** Can see all the bookings on the calendar, but they can't modify or delete them. They have read-only access to settings.
- **Guest** Can be assigned to bookings, but they can't open the booking mailbox.

## Choosing staff roles

Organizations have the flexibility to choose from these staff roles based on their specific needs and requirements. By assigning appropriate roles to staff members, organizations can ensure efficient management of bookings while maintaining control over access to sensitive information.

# Adding staff availability in Microsoft Bookings

In Microsoft Bookings, ensuring that staff members' availability is accurately reflected is essential for managing appointments efficiently. This article will guide you through the process of adding and customizing staff availability for shared bookings.

## Before you begin

Although Bookings is a feature of Microsoft 365, not all of your staff members are required to have a Microsoft 365 account. All staff members must have a valid email address so they can receive bookings and schedule changes.

## Steps for configuring staff availability

1. From the Bookings home page, select the shared booking page you want to add a staff member to.
2. Go to the staff option in the left pane and select **Staff**, then **Add new staff**.
3. When adding staff from within your organization, type their name in the search field and select them when they appear in the drop-down menu. The other fields will automatically populate.
4. **Use business hours** If you wish to use the default business hours set for your business for your staff availability, you can proceed with the checked toggle.

5. **Custom availability for staff members** If you wish to modify default staff availability, uncheck the *Use business hours* toggle.

Here is a glimpse of customized staff availability. Notice that this team member works from 10AM to 2PM, takes a break for two hours, and then returns for a shift from 4PM to 5PM. Not having any specified availability for a given day of the week means that the staff is unavailable for that day of the week.  

Adding staff availability in Microsoft Bookings for shared bookings ensures efficient appointment management. By accurately reflecting staff members' availability, you can streamline the booking process and provide a seamless experience for both staff and customers.

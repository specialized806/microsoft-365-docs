# How to hide a service on your booking page

There could be situations when you want to hide a service from your booking page so customers can't book appointments for that service. This can be helpful in situations such as:

- You are still configuring the service details and settings, and you're not ready for customers to book.
- The service is temporarily unavailable due to staff shortage, maintenance, or date of the service.
- The service is only offered to specific customers or groups, and you don't want to make it public.

To hide a service from your booking page link, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Microsoft Bookings** app and go to the **Services** tab.
2. Choose the service that you want to hide and toggle the switch under **Publishing options** to **Off**. The switch should turn from blue to gray, indicating that the service is hidden.
3. To confirm that the service is hidden, go to the **Booking page** tab and copy the booking page link. Open the link in a new browser window and check if the service is listed. If it's not showing, then the service is successfully hidden.
4. To unhide the service, repeat steps 1 and 2, but turn the toggle switch to **On** instead of **Off**. The switch should turn from gray to blue, indicating that the service is visible. You can verify this by checking the booking page link again.

Hiding a service from your booking page link doesn't delete the service or affect the existing bookings for that service. You can still manage the service details, settings, and bookings in the Microsoft Bookings app.

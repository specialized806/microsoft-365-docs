# Configure service availability in Microsoft Bookings

In Microsoft Bookings, managing service availability is essential for efficient appointment scheduling. Microsoft Bookings makes it easy and convenient for you to manage your service availability and match it with your staff availability. By configuring your service availability, you can ensure that your customers can book your services when you want them to, and that your staff can deliver them efficiently and effectively.

## Service availability categories

There are three categories of service availability.

1. **Bookable when staff are free:** This means that your service will only be available when your staff members who offer this service are also available. This option helps you avoid double-booking or conflicts in your staff's schedule.
2. **Not bookable:** This means that your service cannot be booked by your customers at all. You can use this option if you want to temporarily suspend a service or make it unavailable for online booking. You can still manually book this service from your calendar if you need to.
3. **Custom hours:** This means that you can set a specific weekly schedule for your service availability. This option gives you more flexibility and control over your service schedule.

These options apply to the general availability of your service. If you want to set different availability for a specific date range, you can select "Add a different date range" and enter the start and end dates for that period. Then choose one of the three options for that date range. You can add multiple date ranges with different availability settings, which will override the general availability of your service. This way, you can customize your service availability for holidays, special events, or any other occasions.

## Block availability during certain dates

There may be times when you don't want to accept bookings, such as holidays, vacations, or personal days.

To configure your services as "Not bookable" for the specified dates, follow these steps:

1. Open service settings of the service you want to change your availability for.
2. Select Availability Options.
3. Select **Set availability for a different date range**.
4. Enter the period for which you will not accept any bookings for this service.
5. Select **Not Bookable**.

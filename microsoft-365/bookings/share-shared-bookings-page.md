# Sharing your shared booking page in Microsoft Bookings

After configuring your shared booking page in Microsoft Bookings, it's time to share it with your clients or customers. Follow the steps in this article to learn about how to share the link to your booking page. This will help you reach more potential clients and make it easier for them to book appointments with you.

## Share the booking page link

1. Navigate to the left pane in Microsoft Bookings.
2. From the list of options, choose the **booking page** you want to share.

You can share the link to your booking page using the methods below.

- **Copy Link**: Copy the link to your booking page and share it by email, SMS text messages, Microsoft Teams, in your email signature, or any social media you prefer.
- **Share on Social Media**: Increase visibility by sharing the booking page link on your social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. This will allow potential clients to discover your services and book appointments easily.
- **Share via Email**: Microsoft Bookings provides an option to share the link directly via email. Click the **Email** button, and an automated email function will open, allowing you to send the booking page link to your contacts.
- **Embed in Your Website**: If your organization has a website, embed the booking page link directly so visitors can access your services and schedule appointments without leaving your web environment. Microsoft Bookings allows you to copy the link and the iframe in just one click.

### Benefits of Sharing the Booking Page Link

Sharing your booking page link offers the following advantages:

- **Convenience**: Clients can quickly access your availability and book appointments without phone calls or lengthy interactions.
- **Increased Bookings**: Sharing the link widely expands your reach and attracts more clients. The easier it is for them to book, the more likely they are to choose your services.
- **Professional Image**: A well-designed booking page reflects professionalism and efficiency. Sharing it demonstrates that you value your clients' time and convenience.
- **Time Savings**: When clients self-book through the link, it reduces administrative tasks for you. This frees up your time for other important tasks.

Remember to customize your booking page to align with your organizational needs, set availability, and choose access control options. Sharing your booking page link via email, social media, or your website empowers clients to engage with your services effortlessly.

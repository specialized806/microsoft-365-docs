# Create a new meeting type in Bookings

In this article, you'll learn about meeting types, public and private meetings, and how to create and edit meeting types.

## Personal Bookings

Personal bookings is how you manage your own appointment timeslots, it allows you to easily configure and share your availability with your customers, clients, or colleagues. You can be in charge of your own time and avoid the back and forth of scheduling. You can also set aside time for specific activities by creating meeting types. Once you create a personal booking page, you can share a link with anyone who can then see your availability and easily schedule a time when you're free and is convenient for them.

## Understanding meeting types

There are several kinds of appointments that can be booked with you in Microsoft Bookings. For example, a 30-minute consultation, a 15 minute check-in, or a 60-minute coaching session. You can customize each meeting type with a name, description, duration, location, and availability. Once a meeting type is created and shared, people can book time with you in your preferred time slots.

You can also add buffer time, and confirmation emails and reminders to enhance the booking experience.

## Public and private meeting types

In Microsoft Bookings, meeting types can be categorized using public and private tags to control their visibility and accessibility on your booking page.

- **Public meetings:** A meeting type set as public appears on your personal booking page.
- **Private meetings:** A meeting type set as private will not appear on your personal booking page. To share this specific meeting type, you must share the link directly with the desired recipients.

Mona, a financial advisor, has a personal booking page with several meeting types, including insurance planning and investment management. She sets these meeting types as public so they're visible to all her clients on her booking page.
Mona also provides personalized retirement planning sessions, available only to a select group of clients. She sets this meeting type as private and shares the link only with specific customers interested in booking personalized sessions. By using public and private tags in meeting types, Mona can effectively manage the visibility and accessibility of her services, catering to the needs of both sets of clients.

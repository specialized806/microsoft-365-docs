# Customize your banner image in your personal booking page

Your personal booking page's banner image helps enhance its visual appeal and create a welcoming atmosphere for your customers. This article guides you through the process of editing your banner image and previewing it on your booking page.

## What is a banner image?

The banner image is a visually engaging header displayed at the top of your personal booking page. A well-chosen banner image can help attract attention and encourage customers to explore your offerings further.

## How to edit your banner image

1. **Choose from available options** Microsoft Bookings offers a selection of predesigned banner image options for you to choose from. Browse through the available options and select the one that best aligns with your personal theme.
2. **Preview and save** Once you've selected your desired banner image, preview how it will appear on your customer booking page. Once satisfied, save your changes to apply the new banner image to your booking page.

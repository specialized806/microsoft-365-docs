# Allowing customers to manage their bookings in Shared Bookings

As an administrator, you might want to give your customers the flexibility to manage their bookings, such as rescheduling or canceling appointments. This guide will help you enable the necessary settings in the Microsoft Bookings app.

## Enabling customer management of Bookings

To let customers manage their own bookings, you need to enable this option in the Services settings page of the Bookings app. Here are the steps:

1. Sign in to the **Bookings** app with your Microsoft 365 account.
2. Select the **Services** tab from the left navigation pane.
3. Choose the service you want to edit from the list of services.
4. In the service details page, scroll down when on the **Basic details** page.
5. Toggle the switch next to **Let customers manage their appointment when it was booked by you or your staff on their behalf** on.

Enabling this option will allow customers to access the following features for the selected service:

- **Manage booking button** This button will appear on the customer confirmation email and the booking details page on the web app. Customers can click this button to reschedule, cancel their booking, or contact you for more options.
- **Reschedule** Customers can change the date, time, and staff member for their booking, choosing from available slots on your calendar that match the service duration and requirements. Both you and the staff member will receive an email notification with the updated booking details if the customer reschedules.
- **Cancel booking** Customers can cancel their booking, removing it from your calendar. Both you and the staff member will receive an email notification with the cancellation details if the customer cancels.
- **New booking** This option brings the user to the Self-Service page with all services and staff listed, for scheduling a new booking.

## Recommendations

If you're comfortable with customers accessing the Self-Service page, we recommend leaving this setting enabled.

If you want to limit access to the Self-Service page, we recommend disabling this setting. When this setting is disabled, the user will have no ability to reschedule or cancel their booking when they book through the Calendar tab on the Bookings Web app. When booking through the Self-Service page, however, customers will still have the **Manage Booking button** and all of its options, even when this setting is disabled. Additionally, we suggest adding text to your confirmation and reminder emails that tells your customers how to make changes to their booking through other means, such as by calling the office or emailing the help desk.

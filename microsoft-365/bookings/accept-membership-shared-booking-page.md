# Accept membership to a shared booking page

When a staff member is added to a shared booking page by the owner or another staff member, they receive an email invitation from Microsoft Bookings. The email includes a link to join the shared booking page and accept the membership. The staff member can select the link to open Bookings and see the details of the shared booking page.

Alternatively, the staff member can access the shared booking page from the Bookings homepage. On the homepage, they can see the shared booking pages they have been invited to and choose to accept or decline the invitations. If they haven't already accepted or declined the membership request, they'll see a pop-up requesting membership details of the shared booking pages they've been invited to.

They can then select the shared booking page they want to join and select the Accept button to accept the membership.

A shared booking page can have three states:

- **Accepting bookings** - the staff member has joined the shared booking page.
- **Approve to receive bookings** - the staff member hasn't approved membership.
- **Not accepting bookings** - the staff member has declined to accept bookings.

>[!NOTE]
> A staff member is synonymous with a team member.

Upon setting up a shared booking page for your enterprise and including your team members, an automated email is sent to them to confirm their membership. You can share the above steps with your team so that they can get quickly started with the business.

# Add email reminders and follow-up

Follow-up emails and reminders are essential for maintaining effective communication with customers. Timely reminders for appointments, feedback requests, or expressing gratitude can significantly impact your relationship and results.

## Setting up email reminders

In your meeting type form, follow these steps to set up email reminders:

1. Navigate to **Advanced Settings**.
2. Select **Advanced Settings** and scroll down to locate **Email Reminders**.
3. Select **Add an email reminder** to open the email reminder configuration form.
4. Set the time frame for sending the reminder email, ranging from a 15-minute interval to two weeks before the meeting.
5. Add a customized message in the email body, insert a link, and format the email body to your preference.
6. Select **Save Changes** to finalize your email reminder settings.
Once these steps are completed, your customers will receive the configured email reminder for appointments scheduled with you.

## Setting up email follow-ups

# Use Teams Assignments LTI with Moodle™

This guide provides steps for deploying the Microsoft Teams Assignments Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI®) app in Moodle.

For an overview of all of the Microsoft integrations for learning management systems (LMS), see [Integrating Microsoft products with your Learning Management System](/microsoft-365/lti/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>The user who performs this integration should have a **Site Administrator** role in Moodle with access to manage External tools Plugins.

By installing and using the Teams Assignments LTI app, educators and students can transmit grades to the LMS where the terms of use and privacy policy of that application apply.

## One-time setup by an LMS administrator

Microsoft Teams Assignments is now installed and ready to use on your Moodle site after teachers add it to their courses.

## Add Teams Assignments to a Moodle course as the teacher

After the initial setup of Teams Assignments as an LTI external tool in your Moodle site, course teachers need to add it to their courses to use it with their students.

**To connect a Microsoft Class Team to your course:**

You must have a Microsoft Class Team connected with your Moodle course to link Teams Assignments as activities and to sync grades and feedback.

- It's recommended to [install the Microsoft 365 Moodle plugins](/microsoft-365/lti/moodle-plugin-configuration) to create Class Teams and keep them in sync with your Moodle courses for instructors automatically.
- If the Class Team was created manually or by any other process, the instructor is prompted to connect a team on first access to the Teams Assignments app. They're presented a list of Class Teams in which they have a Teacher (owner) role and that aren't currently linked to any other course. Instructors can choose the Class Teams they wish to connect and save their selection.

> [!NOTE]
> Only Class Teams that aren't already linked to another LMS course are available to connect to a course. More than one Class Team can be linked to an LMS course. However, only one LMS course can be connected to a Class Team at a time. When multiple Class Teams are connected to an LMS course, instructors and students only are able to see and access the Class Teams they're members of.

**To add Teams Assignments to your course as an activity for students:**

1. In Moodle, set your course to **Edit** mode, and navigate to your course and in the course navigation, select **More > LTI External tools**.
1. Find **Teams Assignments** and turn on the **Show in activity chooser** toggle.
1. Navigate back to the course, ensure you are in **Edit** mode, and select **Add an activity or resource** in any of your course section lists.

1. Select the **Select Content** button to launch the Teams Assignments linking UI.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have popups blocked for our app domain, you can see the indicator in the browser address bar and choose to disable popups for this site (see more on popups later in this article).
1. Select one or more existing assignments from the list or select the **Create** button to [create a new Teams Assignment](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/create-an-assignment-in-microsoft-teams-23c128d0-ec34-4691-9511-661fba8599be).
1. Select the **Link** button to link the assignment into your class activity list for students to complete.
1. Select a Teams Assignment in your activity list to see a summary of submitted and returned assignments and to open in Teams for grading. Grades and feedback entered in Teams are automatically transferred to your Moodle gradebook when an assignment is graded and returned to the student.

**To add a static resource launch to your course for assignment sync management and student teams access:**

1. in Moodle, set your course to **Edit** mode, navigate to your course and in the course navigation, and select **More > LTI External tools**.

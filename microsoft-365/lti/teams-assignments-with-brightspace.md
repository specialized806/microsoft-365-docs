# Use Teams Assignments LTI with Desire2Learn Brightspace

This guide provides steps for deploying the Microsoft Teams Assignments Learning Tools Interoperability (LTIÂ®) app in Brightspace.

For an overview of all of the Microsoft integrations for learning management systems (LMS), see [Integrating Microsoft products with your Learning Management System](/microsoft-365/lti/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user who performs this integration should have a Super Administrator or Administrator system role in Brightspace with access to manage External Learning Tools.

By installing and using the Teams Assignments LTI app, educators and students can transmit grades to the LMS where the terms of use and privacy policy of that application apply.

## One-time setup by an LMS administrator

## Deployment options for Class Teams

A Microsoft Class Team must be connected to a Brightspace course to allow the instructor to link Teams Assignments as content and to sync back grades and feedback. There are a few ways to enable instructors to connect a team to their course.

- **Required**: Brightspace users must have their **Institutional Email** set to their Microsoft Entra UPN as described in our [Supporting Institutional Data Mapping](/microsoft-365/lti/teams-classes-with-blackboard) guidance in order to match users between the LMS course and Class Teams enrollments for grade sync.
- **Recommended**: Use the [Course Connector For Class Teams](https://community.d2l.com/brightspace/kb/articles/23776-brightspace-course-connector-for-microsoft-teams) to create teams in sync with your Brightspace courses.
- [Microsoft School Data Sync](/SchoolDataSync/) can also create teams in sync with your Brightspace courses provided you supply the same rostering details via CSV or OneRoster API.

## Browser settings

- Cookies should be allowed for the Microsoft Assignments app.
- Popups shouldn't be blocked for the Microsoft Assignments app.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Cookies aren't allowed by default in the Chrome browser incognito mode and need to be allowed.
> - The Microsoft Assignments app also works in the InPrivate mode in Microsoft Edge browser. Ensure that you haven't blocked cookies, which are allowed by default.

## Ongoing use by course instructors and students

On their first access to the app, course instructors and students need to sign in using their Microsoft 365 / Microsoft Entra ID account to get started.

### Instructors: Connect a Class Team to a course

Instructors must have a Microsoft Class Team connected with their course to link Teams Assignments as content and sync back grades and feedback.

- Follow the instruction in the [Course Connector For Class Teams](https://community.d2l.com/brightspace/kb/articles/23776-brightspace-course-connector-for-microsoft-teams) and then Class Teams are created and connected for you.
- If the Class Team was created manually or by any other process, the instructor is prompted to connect a team on first access to the app. They're presented a list of Class Teams in which they have a Teacher (owner) role and that aren't currently linked to any other course. Instructors can choose the Class Teams they wish to connect and save their selection.

> [!NOTE]
> Only Class Teams that aren't already linked to another LMS course are available to connect to a course. More than one Class Team can be linked to an LMS course. However, only one LMS course can be connected to a Class Team at a time. When multiple Class Teams are connected to an LMS course, instructors and students only are able to see and access the Class Teams they're members of.

# What are cloud subscriptions?

A cloud subscription (also called an *Azure subscription*) is a way to manage the products and services that you buy from Microsoft. A cloud subscription is automatically created when you acquire Azure resources like Virtual Machines, or Enterprise Support and when you get some non-Azure services like Microsoft 365, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and the Microsoft Power Platform. You can view your cloud subscriptions through either the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBladeV2" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> or the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, but you can only manage the subscriptions in the Azure portal.

Cloud subscriptions are different from standard subscriptions in the following ways:

- **No cost for cloud subscriptions**: A cloud subscription doesnâ€™t cost any money. They're used to help you organize and manage the things that you buy. While individual products like calling features and perpetual software managed within a cloud subscription might incur charges, the subscription itself doesn't.
- **Multiple subscriptions**: You can create multiple cloud subscriptions to delegate management to different users in your organization or to apply policies for security, budgeting, and compliance.
- **Familiar management tools in the Azure portal**: If you use other Azure subscriptions, you can manage cloud subscriptions similarly, with more manageability for a broader set of products and services.

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global or Billing Administrator to view your cloud subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md). 
- To manage your cloud subscriptions, you must have the Global Administrator role in the Azure portal.

## Find your cloud subscription

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page and select the **Cloud Subscriptions** tab.
2. Select a subscription name to view the details for that cloud subscription. The details page contains information about costs, billing settings, roles and access, and products included in the cloud subscription.
3. To manage the subscription, at the top of the page, select **Manage this usage-based subscription and its resources in the Azure portal**.

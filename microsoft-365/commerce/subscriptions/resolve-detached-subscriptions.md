# Resolve subscriptions detached from CSP partners in the Microsoft 365 admin center

When you buy a subscription from a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), and that partner is no longer part of the CSP network, they no longer manage your subscription on your behalf. We call these subscriptions *detached subscriptions*. Without an associated partner, if you take no action, the subscription is unmanaged, and access to services will be disrupted. This article explains your options for resolving a detached subscription, either by finding a new partner or buying a subscription directly from Microsoft.

## Find a new partner

If you choose to find a new partner, you can explore available partners through the [Partner Directory on AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/partner-dir?filter=services%3DLicensing). This site lets you search for partners based on your specific products and requirements. When you contact a new partner, make sure to ask if they're a CSP. To learn more about working with a partner, see [Manage Microsoft-certified solution provider partner relationships](../manage-partners.md).

## Buy a subscription directly from Microsoft

When you buy a subscription from Microsoft, we provide direct billing and support. To learn more, see [Learn how to buy a new subscription](../try-or-buy-microsoft-365.md#buy-a-different-subscription) and [Explore Microsoft 365 for business support plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-for-business-support-options?msockid=15af1489bfd667952f27000abefb66ef).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you elect to move and buy your subscription directly with Microsoft, to avoid service disruptions, you must buy a subscription for the same product or service that you currently have with a CSP partner and assign the licenses to the same users.

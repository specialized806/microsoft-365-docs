# View your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Check out all of our small business content on [Small business help & learning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224585).

Check out [Microsoft 365 small business help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659) on YouTube.

You can view your invoice for your Microsoft business subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you need help with interpreting the charges that you see on your invoice, [find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts), then see either [Understand your invoice for your Microsoft MCA billing account](understand-your-invoice.md) or [Understand your invoice for your Microsoft MOSA billing account](understand-your-invoice2.md) for a detailed walkthrough of the billing statement.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 services doesn’t provide payment receipts. For credit or debit card payments, use the invoice and your credit or debit card billing statement to match your payment.

## View your bill or invoice

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**, then select **View invoices**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page.
2. If you have more than one billing account, select **Change billing account** to view invoices associated with each billing account.
3. Select an invoice from the list to view the details online. If you don’t see any invoices, change the date range or select a different Billing account from the Billing account view selector. The invoice details provide useful information including:

   - Date&mdash;date of the charge
   - Service period&mdash;dates the charges apply to. This is the same as the **Purchase charge dates** on the invoice pdf.
   - Transaction type&mdash;gives information about the type of charge. For details, see [Transaction type details](#transaction-type-details).

4. To download the .PDF version of your invoice, select **Download PDF**.
